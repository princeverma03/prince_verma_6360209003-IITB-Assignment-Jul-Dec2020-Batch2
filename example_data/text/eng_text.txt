156 Seconds before Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect 029 a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy who for the last 15 years has been posing as an out of work actor.
Together this dynamic pair began a journey through space aided by a galaxyful of fellow travelers Zaphod Beeblebrox the 2 headed 3 armed exhippie and totally out to lunch president of the galaxy Trillian formerly Tricia McMillan Zaphods girlfriend whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone  Marvin a paranoid brilliant and chronically depressed robot  and Veet Voojagig a former graduate student obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens hes bought over the years.
